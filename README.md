# Webpack / React


It will run on local host 8080


We install webpack locally so that we can manage Webpackâ€™s version per project.



 in th package.json we can do "build": "webpack" instead of "build": "node_modules/.bin/webpack". That is why it is another reason why it is benificial to install webpack loaclly.
